Make filtering step for sequences prior to alignment more logical
Consider use of other models for clustering and tree building
View a dendogram of all specimens to determine if there are any outgroups and use a distance matrix to determine most representative sequence from each species instead of random sampling
Make tree figure look nicer, maybe change colours around, maybe find a way to include the scale bar in the figure
Instead of absolute paths in the code, assume files are in the same working directory so that the code is more reproducible
